			<h3>How To Create A Webpage Using HTML And CSS</h3>
			<p>
				We come across all kinds of documents every day of our lives. Newspapers, insurance forms, shop catalogues... the list goes on. Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce facilities. In all kinds of documents, structure is very important in helping readers to understand the messages you are trying to convey and to navigate around the document. So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents. In this chapter you will: See how HTML describes the structure of a web page. Learn how tags or elements are added to your document. Write your first web page.
			</p>
			<h4>How Pages Use Structure</h4>
			<p>
				Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website. Now think about a very different type of document — an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.
			</p>
			<h4>Structuring Word Documents</h4>
			<p>
				The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information. This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page. When using a word processor to create a document, we separate out the text to give it structure. Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers. On the right, you can see a simple document in Microsoft Word. The different styles for the document, such as different levels of heading, are shown in the drop down box. If you regularly use Word, you might have also used the formatting toolbar or palette to do this.
			</p>
			<h4>HTML Describes the Structure of Pages</h4>
			<p>
				In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page. You can see the HTML code for this page below. Don't worry about what the code means yet. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page. Note that the HTML code is in blue, and the text you see on screen is in black.
			</p>
			<!--- <p>
				<html>
				<body>
					<h5>This is the Main Heading</h5>
					<p>
						This text might be an introduction to the rest of
						the page. And if the page is a long one it might
						be split up into several sub-headings.
					</p>
					<h5>This is a Sub-Heading</h5>
					<p>
						Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
						you follow the structure of what is being written.
						There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
						headings).
					</p>
					<h5>Another Sub-Heading</h5>
					<p>
						Here you can see another sub-heading.
					</p>
				</body>
				</html>
			</p> -->
			<p>
				The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.
			</p>
			<!--<h4>Body, Head & Title</h4>
			<p>
				<h5>Body</h5>
				You met the <span><h5>Body</h5></span> element
				in the first example we created.
				Everything inside this element is
				shown inside the main browser
				window.
				<h5>Head</h5>
				Before the <h5>Body</h5> element you
				will often see a <h5>Head</h5> element.
				This contains information
				about the page (rather than
				information that is shown within
				the main part of the browser
				window that is highlighted in
				blue on the opposite page).
				You will usually find a <h5>Title</h5>
				element inside the <h5>Head</h5>
				element.
				<h5>Title</h5>
				The contents of the <h5>Title</h5>
				element are either shown in the
				top of the browser, above where
				you usually type in the URL of
				the page you want to visit, or
				on the tab for that page (if your
				browser uses tabs to allow you
				to view multiple pages at the
				same time).
			</p>-->
			<h4>Creating a Web Page on a PC</h4>
			<p>
				To create your first web page on a PC, start up Notepad. You can find this by going to: Start All Programs (or Programs),Accessories Notepad You might also like to download a free editor called Notepad++ from notepad-plus-plus.org.Type the code shown on the right. Go to the File menu and select Save as... You will need to save the file somewhere you can remember. If you like, you couldcreate a folder for any examples that you try out from this book. Save this file as first-test. html. Make sure that the Save as type drop down has All Files selected. Start your web browser. Go to the File menu and select Open. Browse to the file that you just created, select it and click on the Open button. The result should look something like the screen shot to the left. If it doesn't look like this, find the file you just created on your computer and make sure that it has the file extension .html (if it is .txt then you need to go back to Notepad and save the file again, but this time put quote marks around the name "firsttest.html").
			</p>
			<h4>Code in a Content Management System</h4>
			<p>
				If you are working with a content management system, blogging platform, or e-commerce application, you will probably log into a special administration section of the website to control it. The tools provided in the administration sections of these sites usually allow you to edit parts of the page rather than the entire page, which meansyou will rarely see the HTML HEAD, or BODY elements. Looking at the content management system on the opposite page, you have a box that allows you to enter a titlefor the page, another box for the main article, a way to enter apublication date, and somethingto indicate which section of thesite this page belongs in.For an e-commerce store, you might have boxes that allow youto enter a title for the product,a description of the product, itsprice, and the quantity available. That is because they use a single 'template' to control all of the pages for a section of the site. (For example, an e-commerce system might use the same template to show all of their products.) The information you supply is placed into the templates. The advantage of this approach is that people who do not know how to write web pages can add information to a website and it is also possible to change the presentation of something in the template, and it will automatically update every page that uses that template. If you imagine an e-commerce store with 1,000 items for sale, just altering one template is a lot easier than changing the page for each individual product. In systems like this, when you have a large block of text that you can edit, such as a news article, blog entry or the description of a product in an e-commerce store, you will often see a text editor displayed. Text editors usually have controls a little like those on your word processor, giving you different options to style text, add links or insert images. Behind the scenes these editors are adding HTML code to your text, just like the code you have seen earlier in this chapter. Many of these editors will have an option that allows you to see (and edit) the code that they produce. Once you know how to read and edit this code, you can take more control over these sections of your website. In the example above, you can see that the text editor has a tab for Visual / HTML views of what the user enters. Other systems might have a button (which often shows angle brackets) to indicate how to access the code. Some content management systems offer tools that also allow you to edit the template files. If you do try to edit template files you need to check the documentation for your CMS as they all differ from each other. You need to be careful when editing template files because if you delete the wrong piece of code or add something in the wrong place the site may stop working entirely.

			<h4>Looking At How Other Sites Are Built</h4>
			<p>
				When the web was first taking off, one of the most common ways to learn about HTML and discover new tips and techniques was to look at the source code that made up web pages. These days there are many more books and online tutorials that teach HTML, but you can still look at the code that a web server sends to you. To try this out for yourself, simply go to the sample code for this chapter, at www.htmlandcssbook.com/ code/ and click on the link called "View Source." Once you have opened this page, you can look for the View menu in your browser, and select the option that says Source or View source. (The title changes depending on what browser you are using.) You should see a new window appear, and it will contain the source code that was used to create this page. You can see this result in the photograph on the right. The page you see is the window at the top; the code is below. At first this code might look complicated but don't be discouraged. By the time you have finished the next chapter of this book, you will be able to understand it. All of the examples for this book are on the website, and you can use this simple technique on any of the example pages to see how they work. You can also download all of the code for this book from the same website by clicking on the "Download" link.

				<ul>
					<li>HTML pages are text documents.</li>
					<li>HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.</li>
					<li>Tags are often referred to as elements.</li>
					<li>Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.</li>
					<li>Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.</li>
					<li>Attributes require a name and a value.</li>
					<li>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.</li>
